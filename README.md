Origional data is downloaded into:
.\inputs\Hydrometeorological Data 2020

The rainfall data (.\inputs\Hydrometeorological Data 2020\Rain Gagues Data _ Monthly 2020_) is then converted into .csv and saved in:
.\inputs\precipitation_data\2020

This data is then used in the script. The different files are joined together.
